    <h2>Ryan Donaldson</h2>
    <p id="first_p">Hello! I am a software engineering and this is my 5th semester of college.
        Prior to now I had no idea what I wanted to major in, so I'm just beginning to take classes for a major.
        Some things I love to do are sing, dance, read, play video games, hangout with my friends, go hiking, and take naps.
        The thing I love the most about BYU-Idaho is the spirit that can be felt on campus.
    <p id="second_p">I have been a member of the Church my whole life. Something I love to do on campus is attending stadium singing
        on Sundays underneath the stadium seats at 9:30 pm. We all gather there and sing hymns a capella. The spirit that 
        can be felt there is incredible.
