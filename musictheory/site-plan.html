      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The idea for my website is having a place where people can come to learn about the basics of music theory so that they can become better musicians. Whether they want to educate themselves more about music to become a better singer or play an instrument, people who come to the site will be able to learn a variety of things about music theory. Things they can learn about include sheet music, note names, and clefs. I will educate them about the different note values, sharps, flats, and naturals, time signatures, and rests. 

Note names range from A-G moving up and down the staff. These notes are written on the staff, and are placed on lines or in spaces depending on which note they are. The notes near, at, and above middle C are written on the staff with a Treble clef at the beginning to delineate where the notes are played. The time signature for the piece can be found near the clef, written as what looks like a fraction. Common time signatures include 4/4, ¾, 6/8, and 2/4. I will also teach about whole steps and half steps. Easily viewed on a keyboard with the black and white keys, these refer to how much space is between one note and another. We can use the hashtag symbol ‘#’ to tell someone that a note is meant to be ‘sharp’, or played a half step up from where it is written. We use what looks like a lowercase letter ‘b’ to tell someone that a note is ‘flat’, or played a half step down from where it is written.

      <h3>Music Theory — Vocal</h3>
      <p>
        For those wanting to learn more about music to become better singers, I will provide info about voice types and the different parts each one sings in a choir or group like a church congregation. I will seek to do this by providing an image of a typical choral arrangement and explaining which line the different voice types sing. I will talk about these voice types, namely sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses and what they mean. That will include talking about vocal cords, gender, voice types changing with age, and rarer voice types like countertenors and coloratura sopranos.

        In a choral piece, the line which sopranos are to sing will be the line of notes which are highest on the sheet music with the treble clef. The line the altos sing will be below the soprano line, also in the treble clef. Moving downward into the bass clef, the tenor line consists of the higher notes on the staff with the bass clef. Finally, we have the bass line. These are the lowest notes on the sheet music in the bass clef.

      <h3>Music Theory — Continued</h3>
      <p>
        A major scale follows this pattern: WWHWWWH. These stand for whole steps and half steps. The minor scale follows this pattern: WHWWHWW. Dynamics tell us how loud or soft to play or sing a section of music. ‘Piano’, usually written as p on sheet music, tells us to play or sing quietly. Conversely, ‘Forte’ (f) means to play or sing loudly. We can change the dynamics throughout a piece of music, and one of these ways includes the use of crescendos and decrescendos. Delineated by this symbol: <, to crescendo means to grow louder. Decrescendos are used to do the opposite. When you see this symbol: >, that means grow softer.
