                        The image to the left shows what is called the music staff. <br> The symbol on the upper set of lines is called the treble clef. <br> The symbol below is called the bass clef. <br> These clefs tell us where the notes written on the staff are
                        compared to middle C. Middle C is the C in the middle of a piano keyboard. Notes above middle C are written on the upper portion of the staff with the treble clef, and the notes below middle C are written on the lower portion of the staff with the bass clef. Music notes
                        on the staff are written either on the lines or in the spaces; this helps us know which note is which.

                    <h2>
                        The image on the right shows notes written on the staff. <br> In music, notes are named using the letters A through G. <br> As can be seen, once all the letters are used they repeat. <br> The distances between notes are referred to as intervals. <br> The distance between two notes of the same
                        name is known as an octave. Remember middle C? That is the C on the staff with the line through it. That line is called a ledger line. <br> We use ledger lines to help us keep track of notes not written on any of the five lines or spaces in the main staff.
